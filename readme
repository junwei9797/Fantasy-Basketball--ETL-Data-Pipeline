End-to-End Data Pipeline (ETL) for Fantasy Basketball
Tech stack: Airflow, Python (Pandas), PostgreSQL, Docker
Data flow:
    1) Ingest nba score data via NBA API
    2) Transform using Pandas
    3) Store in PostgreSQL
    Bonus: Visualize with Tableau

Pipeline is deployed on Docker, and scheduled to run daily with Airflow
(Apache airflow will create spin up docker containers to run the job, doing so makes it easier to integrate to Kubernetes in the future)
